# .easignore
# EAS Build uses this file to determine what to upload to the build server.
# By default, it follows .gitignore.
# We want to force-include google-services.json even though it is git-ignored for security.

# Inherit directly from .gitignore
# (No explicit include needed if we don't start with excluding everything, 
# BUT wait, EAS respects gitignore. So if it is in gitignore, EAS ignores it too.)
# To include a file that is in .gitignore, we must negate it here.
